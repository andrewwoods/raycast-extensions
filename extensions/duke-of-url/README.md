# Duke of URL 

__Easily Work with parts of a URL__

It should be easy to work with URLs. However, they can be fragile, and difficult to
edit. There's something wonderful about clean, well-crafted URLs. The Duke of
URL is here to help.


## Version

The current version is 0.1.0. This project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).


## Features

### Edit Query Parameters

It should be easy to edit the query parameters for a page. This gives you a
form for you change any value of a value in the query string. When you submit
the form, the new values will replace those in your original URL, and copy it
to your clipboard.. The domain name and the path will remain the same.

**Tip**: Setting the value to a `-` or an empty string will remove the
parameter from the new URL.

### Extract Different versions of the URL

A URL can get quite long — especially when you have many query parameters included.
This extension makes it simple to create different versions of the original URL,
and copy the one you want.

* Copy the Root URL
* Copy the Page URL without any query parameters

### Test URLs

To see how the Duke operates, here are some URLs you can try with the Extract
and Edit commands.
